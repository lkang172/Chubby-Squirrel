    <p>Jade Mountain. It sounds like paradise. It's also located in a place that's called Formosa, or "beautiful island". You probably just know it as Taiwan. Just like Ali Mountain, Jade Mountain is located on the small yet beautiful island of Taiwan. Unlike Ali Mountain, Jade Mountain has the highest elevation of all mountains in southeastern Asia. That said, it is more for people who like to climb and hike up mountains than people who just want to look at the view, though the view is brilliant too. There are trails, some easy but most hard, that one must climb to get on the top of the mountain. It's fairly easy to scale for a tall mountain, taking only two days if you're fast. Don't let that discourage you, though, as you can always go up the mountain to sightsee anyways!</p>
