    <p>This beach located in Delaware is a very nice beach to play in, although it is a little bit crowded at times. I went there this Summer for two days, and it was awesome. The beach is partly located in Cape Henlopen state park, which offers free bikes for you to use. One thing that you must remember is this: It can get crowded, and always bring an umbrella if you're going to stay on the beach. I had a great time swimming around in the ocean, although it was a bit cold. Have fun!</p>
