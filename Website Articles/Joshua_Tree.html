<h1>Joshua Tree National Park</h1>

<p>&emsp;My family and I went to Joshua Tree National Park in California in June of 2018. The purpose of that trip was to visit my cousins who had moved there three years prior. We had a large family reunion, with grandparents from both sides attending. We went to many places, including the Japanese Garden and Griffith Observatory. However, my personal favorite was Joshua Tree National Park.</p>

<p>&emsp;Like all other national parks, this one is special in it's own way. The park is named after the beautiful and unique Joshua Trees that call it their home. There are many trails, of varying difficulties, to hike on. Because I live near forests, hikinh in deserts is always an amazing experience for me. All the various shrubs and cacti are really miraculous to hike through.</p>
<p>&emsp;If you plan on going to Joshua Tree, staying until after dark is a MUST. You can see the beautiful Milky Way from the national park, and it's truly extraordinary. It was also the first time I've ever seen the Big Dipper in real life (that's what living in a suburban area does to one). We had just arrived at the park that first day, and it was already almost 6PM. After getting a quick bite to eat, we met up with my mom's friend, who is also a local tour guide. He led us into the national park, and we got out of our cars to see a natural spectacle that actually takes place every night, but have few witnesses. Stars in the night sky! As you can see in the pictures in the article, sunset is amazingly beautiful in the park, which is an added plus!</p>

<p>&emsp;My family and I also went to 29 Palms, a city near Joshua Tree. Mount San Jacinto State Park is located there, and there is an aerial tramway that rotates as it takes you up the mountain and then back down. The sight is breathtaking. On top of the mountain, there are conifer forests and many big pinecones that are characteristic of many Californian national parks (Yosemite also has enormous pinecones!). If you're not used to hot conditions, beware of the heat, and bring extra water! Temperatures in Palm Springs and Joshua Tree can be sweltering, especially in the summer! Make the proper preparations, and your trip will be an experience you won't soon forget.</p>
