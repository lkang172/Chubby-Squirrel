      <h2>Cape Henlopen</h2>
      <p style="margin-right: 20px">Throughout the course of the past year, <a href="https://chubbysquirrel.neocities.org/campingtrip.html">Cape Henlopen State Park</a> has become one of my favorite parks to visit. With its breathtaking scenery, viewable from tall observation towers dotting the landscape, and beaches on which beachgoers can relax and play, going to this park is truly killing two birds with one stone. The photo on the left was taken at around 5:45 AM, on a beautiful, crisp late June morning. The sun was just beginning to show itself over the horizon, and since I'm an early riser, I decided to go meet it. My friend, who had also arose, came with me. We treaded silently out of the campsite, careful not to wake any sleeping campers, and headed towards the military base which was only 3 minutes away. From there, we took the path all the way up to the museum. Along the trail, there were a few alcoves in which one could take in the rolling dunes below. I took the picture to the left while doing so. The ocean is just along the horizon, and you can see the sprawling dunes, illuminated in the early morning sunlight.</p>

      <h2>Devil's Golfcourse</h2>
      <p>The above picture was taken during my trip to Death Valley National Park back in the spring of 2019. The jagged rocks and the barren, hostile landscape in general make this location distinct. Although there is an altogether lack of vibrancy and color, there is a sense of tranquility (provided there aren't too many tourists around), the effect of only being able to see salt rock flats nearly identical to the one pictured above for as far as the eye can see. Tourists can saunter about this "golfcourse", examining the peculiar formations which make up this unwelcoming putting green. The hunks of rock you see are actually pieces of rock salt, which have been eroded over the millions of years for which they've been present. This is perhaps one of my favorite locations in Death Valley, if only for its uniqueness.</p>
