    <p>Yosemite National Park is located near Fresno, California. I went there a couple years ago, and I still haven't forgotten it to this day. First, there is that smell that you only get when you go somewhere ancient, somewhere undeveloped by humans, somwhere untouched. Ok, well, Yosemite is touched by maybe a couple hundred, maybe a couple thousand people each day, but you get the idea. And if you don't know about that amazing smell that you get only in nature, then that's all the more the reason for you to go to the park. There are big pinecones, awesome rock climbing and hiking trails, and awesome sightseeing places. VISIT NOW!!!</p>
