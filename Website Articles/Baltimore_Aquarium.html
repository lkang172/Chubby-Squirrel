    <p>Baltimore Aquarium, also called the National Aquarium, is located in Baltimore, Maryland. I've been there twice or so, and still want to go again. The Baltimore Aquarium includes a stunning display of both saltwater and freshwater fish. Additionally, there is a rainforest exhibit full of unique and beautiful animals that are out of this world. Next time you come to the United States East Coast, or if you live here, make sure to pay this aquarium a visit! While here, you can also check out the harbor and board some old ships used during various wars!
