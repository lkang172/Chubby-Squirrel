    <p>Disney World, in Orlando, Florida, is a very fun place for the whole family to visit! If you like roller coasters, or are a great fan of Star Wars (like me), then you'd really want to think about going there. I went there in 2015, and the experience was unforgettable. My favorite one was Animal Kingdom, because you get to go on a safari ride with exotic creatures! I also liked "Expedition Everest", which is an exhilarating roller coaster that takes you through a scaled down version of Mount Everest. Chances are that you've probably heard of Disney World before. Why not go and experience the magic for yourself?</p>
