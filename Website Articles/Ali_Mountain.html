    <p>Ali Mountain is located in Taiwan, a small country (or province, depending on who you ask) right next to China. I went there a couple of years ago, and the experience was unforgettable. I really liked the mountains and the fresh air on them. The scenery there is amazing! I know that I've already posted a place in Taiwan, but I have to keep posting more. Reason? Taiwan is also called Formosa (Beautiful) and it definitely lives up to its name! There is a small train there that takes you through cherry blossoms, tea farms, as well as the thick forest of the ancient mountain itself. This mountain is mainly for the whole family, for people who don't really like to hike up mountains, people who just want to go sightseeing and see the vibrant culture of Taiwan.</p>
