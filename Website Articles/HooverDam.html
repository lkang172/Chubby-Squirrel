    <h1>Hoover Dam</h1>
        <p><font size="2"><i>Pictures and Paragraph By Chubby Squirrel</i></font></p>
    <p>&emsp; Hoover Dam. Everyone's heard of this place, yet most have not been here. When I went to Las Vegas last year, I also went to Hoover Dam just to take a look! Although the booming sound of the water and the sheer size of the Dam was breathtaking, I did not really enjoy this more than any of the other places I went to in Nevada/Arizona. I would recommend visiting Hoover Dam, but I wouldn't make plans to spend my whole day there, because besides taking pictures and watching movies, there's really not much else to do. However, that's only my experience, so don't listen to me, go see for yourself! :)</p>
    <p>&emsp; Below, I am going to post some of the pictures I took there! The dam is truly a feat of engineering!</p>
