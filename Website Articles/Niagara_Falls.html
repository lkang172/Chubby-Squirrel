    <p>Niagara Falls is arguably the most famous waterfall in the world, besides Angel Falls, and rightfully so. My family and I drove there in the spring of 2013 for a two day vacation. It was a long time ago, so I do not remember much about it. However, it was quite a fun experience! The roar of the waterfall is truly something special, not often seen in your daily life. Besides, visiting another country is always a plus.</p>
