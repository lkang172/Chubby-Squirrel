                <p>A waterfall in the mountains of Wulai in Taiwan. I went hiking there in the summer of 2023 during my Taiwan trip. The hike was hot and humid - just like most other hikes in Taiwan - but the area around the waterfall had a cool breeze.</p>

                <p>Some fossilized tree trunk pieces in Petrified Forest National Park, which we visited in 2022. The organic tree material was replaced by stone tens of millions of years ago, and what used to be long trunks broke into small chunks. Legend has it that if you steal petrified wood pieces from the park, you'll have bad luck. In the visitor center, there were some remorseful letters on display from those who stole and regretted it.</p>

              <p>Sunrise at 5 AM in Hualien, Taiwan. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful places on the island, Hualien has beaches alongside massive mountains. Although swimming was prohibited on this particular beach due to unpredictable currents, it had colorful stones which I took many pictures of (but did not take any).</p>

              <p>One of the trails I hiked on in Grand Canyon National Park. It winded down the side of a cliff, and the wind was so strong that I almost felt like I was going to be blown away at some points. This was during the pandemic, so my facemask came in handy to prevent all the dust that was getting blown around.</p>

              <p>On a hike with my friends last winter, we came upon a section which was completely frozen over. The trail ran alongside a stream, which was also completely covered in ice. We ended up getting past the slippery surface, but not without finding ourselves on our behinds a few times along the way.</p>

              <p>A peaceful scene taken straight out of a children's Christmas book. I went skiing in the winter of 2022 at Deep Creek Lake, and of course, I had to go on a hike around the lake. The snow-blanketed forest was absolutely magical. The best thing is it didn't even feel super cold!</p>
