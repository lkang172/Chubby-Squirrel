        <p>These articles are ordered by date, starting from the newest ones and ending in the oldest ones. For some, I didn't know the date on which I wrote them (e.g. Joshua Tree), so I put the date on which I visited that specific place instead.

          <p>After four long years of COVID travel restrictions, I was finally able to visit Taiwan again this summer! My parents and I stayed for three weeks, and got to see aunts, uncles, grandparents, and old friends.

              <p>To preface, I've only gone skiing once before, when I was five years old. We went with some friends, because nobody in my family is of the winter sports type - we despise the cold - and all I can recall is that I was forced to attend a ski class, during which I fell once and couldnâ€™t get up, and ended up being left behind. Not a pleasant experience...<br><a href="https://chubbysquirrel.neocities.org/skiing"><font color="#ff333a">Continue Reading<i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i></font></a></p>
