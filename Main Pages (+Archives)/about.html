              <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
              <p>Welcome to the website! My online alias is <u style="color:coral">Chubby Squirrel</u> (inspired by a very cute and chubby squirrel I saw at the park one day), and I live on the United States East Coast. Generally, I'm quite outdoorsy. My hobbies include hiking, biking, running long distance, kayaking, coding, and playing videogames (most of all, Minecraft). In addition, I enjoy traveling, when possible, and write articles regarding the places I have visited and my experiences with them. The photos that you see in my website are all (with few, mentioned, exceptions) taken by yours truly, although I dare not proclaim myself a photographer. I have an old (17 y/o) <strong>cockapoo dog</strong>, who is my best friend, (featured on the right -->) and numerous fish for companions. I hope you enjoy my informational blog-style website!</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>National Parks I have visited (in the US):</strong> Yosemite, Joshua Tree, Zion, Grand Canyon, Shenandoah, Petrified Forest, Great Falls, Everglades, Death Valley, New River Gorge, Great Smoky Mountains</p>
              <br>

                <h2>Past Designs</h2>
                <p>Below are some of our old designs! It's unbelievable how much we've changed in such just a few years!</p>
                <img src="https://chubbysquirrel.neocities.org/Photos/about%20page%20old.png" width="100%">
                <i>The above design is from late 2020, and it was the preceding design. As you can see, the aquapage, gamepage, and travelpage were all discontinued, mainly due to a lack of interest and content.</i>
                <br><br>
                <img src="https://chubbysquirrel.neocities.org/Photos/chubby%20squirrel%20homepage.png" width="100%" alt="A home patge design">
                <i>The above design was short-lived, mainly because of how dreary and colorless it looked.</i>
                <br><br>
                <img src="https://chubbysquirrel.neocities.org/Photos/Chubby%20squirrel%20home%20page%20old.png" width="100%">
                <i>The above home page was the predecessor for the preceding screenshot. The background image had a parallax effect on scroll and was featured since early 2019.</i>

              <h1>ABOUT THE WEBSITE</h1>
               <p>This website was started in <strong><u style="color:cornflowerblue">2018</u></strong>, for me to showcase my writing and the places I've been. Since then, it's grown into so much more, but at it's core, it is still essentially my forum for expressing my interests via articles and my place to experiment with coding. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to ask on my neocities page. All kinds of topics will be posted on this website. I hope it can teach you something, or inspire you to go somewhere. Thanks for viewing Chubby's Webpage, and have an amazing rest of your day/night!</p>
