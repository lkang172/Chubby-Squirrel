                  <p>&emsp;After four long years of COVID travel restrictions, I was finally able to visit Taiwan again this summer! My parents and I stayed for three weeks, and got to see aunts, uncles, grandparents, and old friends. I was especially excited to see my cousins, who came at the same time as us from California, whom I haven’t seen since 2018. Flying from our house on the US east coast to Los Angeles took five hours, and then we had to wait in the airport for eight more hours before boarding a 12-hour flight to Taiwan. Needless to say, the journey was unenjoyable. However, as I stepped foot out of the Taoyuan International Airport, the distinctive, humid air recalled fond memories of trips in years past.</p>

                  <p>&emsp;To preface, I've only gone skiing once before, when I was five years old. We went with some friends, because nobody in my family is of the winter sports type - we despise the cold - and all I can recall is that I was forced to attend a ski class, during which I fell once and couldn’t get up, and ended up being left behind. Not a pleasant experience, to be sure. But despite the fact that I vowed never to go skiing again after the tragic incident, there I was, careening down the slopes, more than a decade later, mouth gaping open but emitting no sound in utter terror as I “pizza’d” in vain, knowing that breaking that vow I made to myself all those years ago had been a (hopefully not fatal) mistake...</p>

                  <p>&emsp;Everglades National Park is the third largest national park in the lower 48 states, infested with all manner of voracious man-eating beasts. Just kidding about the latter part; the alligators and crocodiles are actually all very docile and well-behaved, preferring to sit in the middle of a well-travelled trail waiting for food to come lumbering by instead of spending energy on chasing down dinner. For whatever reason, I allowed myself to be taken along on a three-day excursion to this swampy excuse for a national park. What's even more surprising than me going? I actually ended up liking it despite myself...</p>

              <p>This is a question that I get asked a lot. After all, it is a unique site name/alias. Well, it all started a very long time ago, when I saw a (you guessed it) "chubby" squirrel at the park, minding his own business. He ended up becoming the namesake for the website.</p>
